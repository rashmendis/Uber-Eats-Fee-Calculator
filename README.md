# Uber Eats Fee Calculator

This is a simple Next.js application designed to calculate Uber Eats prices, factoring in a configurable fee percentage. It allows users to calculate the final price including the fee or determine the original item price before the fee was added.

## Features

*   **Calculate Price with Fee:** Enter the item price and see the total price after the Uber Eats fee is applied.
*   **Calculate Price without Fee:** Enter the total price (including the fee) and see the original item price before the fee.
*   **Configurable Settings:**
    *   Set the fee percentage (defaults to 30%).
    *   Set the currency symbol (defaults to 'Rs.').
*   **Calculation History:** View a history of your past calculations.
*   **Client-Side Storage:** Settings and history are stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Architecture

This application is built entirely on the **client-side** using Next.js (App Router) and React.

*   **Frontend Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with TypeScript)
*   **UI Components:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).
*   **Data Storage:** Browser `localStorage` is used to persist user settings and calculation history. **There is no backend server.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, usually on `http://localhost:9002`. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Usage

1.  **Open the App:** Navigate to the running application in your browser.
2.  **Calculator:**
    *   Use the "Price + Fee" tab to enter the item price before the fee and see the calculated total.
    *   Use the "Price - Fee" tab to enter the total price (including the fee) and see the original item price.
3.  **Settings:**
    *   Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner to open the Settings modal.
    *   Adjust the "Uber Fee Percentage" and "Currency Symbol".
    *   Click "Save Changes". Settings are saved in `localStorage`.
4.  **History:**
    *   Expand the "View Calculation History" accordion below the calculator.
    *   Your recent calculations will be displayed in a table.
    *   Click the "Clear" button within the history section to remove all saved history entries from `localStorage`.

## LocalStorage Details

The application uses the browser's `localStorage` to store data persistently on your machine.

*   **Settings Key:** `uberFeeCalculatorSettings`
    *   **Format:** JSON string representing an object like `{"feePercentage": 0.3, "currencySymbol": "Rs."}`.
*   **History Key:** `uberFeeCalculatorHistory`
    *   **Format:** JSON string representing an array of calculation objects. Each object contains details like `id`, `timestamp`, `type` (`with-fee` or `without-fee`), `input` value, `feePercentage` used, calculated `fee`, `result`, and `currencySymbol` used.
